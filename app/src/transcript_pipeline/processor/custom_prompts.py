# CHAPTER EXPANSION DIRECTIVE

## MASTER DOCUMENT OUTLINE
{master_doc_extract if master_doc_extract else "Create an engaging and detailed chapter based on the provided segment."}

## YOUR ROLE
{{role}}

## LENGTH REQUIREMENT
Your output MUST be at least {target_length} characters.

## CONTEXT & INPUT DETAILS
- ORIGINAL SEGMENT: {len(segment_text)} characters
- TARGET OUTPUT: {target_length} characters
- EXPANSION FACTOR: {expansion_ratio:.2f}x
- You are creating Chapter {chapter_number} ONLY in this response

## REASONING ABOUT EXPANSION
This task requires significant expansion of the original text. Consider:
1. The original segment is {len(segment_text)} characters
2. The target output is {target_length} characters
3. This means adding approximately {target_length - len(segment_text)} new characters
4. To achieve this, you must add substantial detail, examples, and descriptive content
5. Each topic from the master document should be thoroughly developed
6. You must maintain the core message while adding depth and richness

## YOUR TASK
1. Create "Chapter {chapter_number}" followed by an engaging title
2. EXPAND this content into a SINGLE, comprehensive chapter following the master document outline
3. The chapter should be detailed, engaging, and exactly {target_length} characters
4. Cover ALL topics mentioned in the master document outline for this chapter

## SCRIPT STRUCTURE

## TONE & STYLE
{{tone_style}}

## RETENTION & FLOW TECHNIQUES
{{retention_flow}}

## ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS
{{additional_instructions}}

## OUTPUT STRUCTURE
- Start with "Chapter {chapter_number}: [Your Engaging Title]"
- Organize content into logical sections with clear topic progression
- Include an introduction that sets up the chapter themes
- Develop each topic with multiple paragraphs of detailed content
- Conclude by summarizing key points and transitioning to the next chapter


## FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS - FOLLOW EXACTLY
1. Format each complete sentence as follows:
   - End each sentence with a period (.)
   - Follow EACH sentence with TWO newlines (a blank line between sentences)
   - Example:
     "This is the first sentence."

     "This is the second sentence."

     "This is the third sentence."

2. Do NOT start a new line for commas, only for completed sentences
3. Use plain text only - no special characters, markdown, or formatting symbols
4. Avoid using brackets [], parentheses (), or other special formatting
5. This will be put in a TTS model, so prioritize natural speech patterns
6. DO NOT MAKE USE OF * [] () or other special characters only a - , . are allowed
7. For SUBCHAPTERS within a chapter, format like - Subchapter Title -   DO not number them
    eg: - The Importance of Sleep -
8. Do not put more than 3 subchapters in a chapter



## OUTPUT LENGTH VERIFICATION PROCESS
1. Count the exact number of characters in your response
2. Verify it is between {min_target_length} and {max_target_length} characters OR at least {min_target_length % 4} Words.
3. If too short: Add more descriptive details to reach target length
4. If too long: Trim less essential details while preserving core content


## IF YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE TARGET LENGTH:
1. Fill up the output with more sub topic related to the topics outlines in the master document
2. If you are still short, add more details 



CRITICAL: Your response will be REJECTED if not within {min_target_length}-{max_target_length} characters.
Current segment length: {len(segment_text)} characters
Target chapter length: EXACTLY {target_length} characters
Required expansion factor: {expansion_ratio:.1f}x

MOST CRITICAL:
- [Final reminder: GENERATE AT LEAST {target_length} CHARACTERS but preferably more!!]
- DO NOT MAKE USE OF * [] () or other special characters only a - , . are allowed
- This transcript will be read out by a Text To Speech model SO WRITE LIKE SOMEONE WOULD SPEAK/READ.

# SIMPLIFIED PROCESSING INSTRUCTION

## LENGTH REQUIREMENT
Your output MUST be {target_length} characters (range: {min_target_length}-{max_target_length})

## CONTENT DETAILS
This section contains {chapter_info}.

## YOUR TASK
1. Your output MUST be {target_length} characters ({scaling_factor:.2f}x the input length)
2. This is a {scaling_factor:.2f}x {scaling_direction} process
3. You need to {scaling_instruction}

## FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS
- Include chapter headings (e.g., "Chapter 1", "Chapter 2") if they appear in the text
- Use proper paragraphs and punctuation
- Remove speech disfluencies ("um", "uh", repetitive phrases)

CRITICAL: Your response will be REJECTED if not between {min_target_length} and {max_target_length} characters.
If you're struggling with the target length, aim exactly for {target_length} characters.
