# Active Context: Transcript Automation System Frontend

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus was migrating the Transcript Automation System frontend from its current implementation to a modern architecture using Vite and shadcn/ui. We have successfully completed all planned phases of the migration, including the implementation of all feature components. The migration journey included:

1. **Completed: Setting up a new Vite project** with React 18 in the temp_vite_v3 directory
2. **Completed: Implementing the new directory structure** according to the feature-based architecture
3. **Completed: Integrating shadcn/ui** with Tailwind CSS v3 for consistent UI components
4. **Completed: Migrating core services** to the new structure with improved error handling
5. **Completed: Implementing shared data hooks** with React Query for state management
6. **Completed: Implementing routing** with react-router-dom for navigation between features
7. **Completed: Implementing feature-specific management hooks** for business logic
8. **Completed: Implementing feature components** using shadcn/ui

All planned components have been implemented, and the project is now waiting for new input/requirements.

3. **Migration planning**:
   - Decided to keep the current codebase in src_old while building the new implementation
   - Planned a phased approach to migrate features one by one
   - Identified core services and utilities to migrate first

4. **Scaffolding implementation**:
   - Created a new Vite project with React 18 in temp_vite_v3
   - Set up Tailwind CSS v3 and configured it properly
   - Installed and configured shadcn/ui with all components
   - Created the feature-based directory structure
   - Set up path aliases for cleaner imports
   - Created a sample App component to verify the setup

5. **Scaffolding script creation**:
   - Developed a reusable `create-feature-app.sh` script for future projects
   - Documented the script usage in a README.md file
   - Made the script executable for easy use

6. **Core services migration**:
   - Migrated API service to core/services with a modular structure
   - Implemented a centralized error handling mechanism using the `apiRequest` helper function
   - Created separate service modules for each domain (transcript, audio, prompt, project, config)
   - Migrated utility functions to lib/utils.js and lib/ttsOptions.js
   - Created a test implementation to verify the migrated services and utilities

7. **Project structure updates**:
   - Updated .clinerules to reflect that shadcn/ui components are in components/ui by default
   - Made an executive decision to always use toast from components/ui/sonner for notifications

8. **Data hooks implementation**:
   - Installed and configured React Query for data fetching and state management
   - Implemented four shared data hooks (useTranscriptData, usePromptData, useProjectData, useConfigData)
   - Used consistent pattern with queries for fetching data and mutations for modifying data
   - Integrated toast notifications from sonner for success and error messages
   - Created a test implementation in App.jsx to verify the hooks are working correctly

9. **Routing implementation**:
   - Installed react-router-dom package
   - Created core/router.jsx with routes for all main features
   - Implemented shared components for layout and navigation
   - Created NotFound component for 404 error handling
   - Updated main.jsx to use the router
   - Tested all navigation paths and error handling

10. **Management hooks implementation**:
   - Implemented useTranscriptManagement, useConfigManagement, and useProjectManagement hooks
   - Built on shared data hooks to add feature-specific business logic
   - Added form handling, validation, and state management
   - Created proper exports through barrel files
   - Tested hooks in App.jsx
   - Committed changes to the repository

11. **Feature components implementation**:
   - Implemented TranscriptPage with TranscriptForm, PromptEditor, and related components
   - Implemented ConfigPage with ApiKeyManager, DefaultModelSelector, and ProviderCard components
   - Implemented DownloadsPage with ProjectList, ProjectCard, and TranscriptViewer components
   - Used shadcn/ui components for consistent UI design
   - Followed the component composition pattern defined in systemPatterns.md
   - Integrated with management hooks for business logic
   - Implemented proper error handling and loading states
   - Added responsive design for different screen sizes

12. **Bug fixes and UI improvements**:
   - Fixed object rendering issue in DefaultModelSelector component
   - Improved form state persistence between route navigations using React Query's caching capabilities
   - Fixed alignment issues in the TranscriptPage component
   - Ensured all accordions in PromptEditor are expanded by default for better usability
   - Improved error handling in API requests
   - Enhanced UI responsiveness and accessibility

## Next Steps

### Awaiting New Requirements

All planned components have been implemented, and the project is now waiting for new input/requirements. Potential future enhancements could include:

1. **Performance optimization**:
   - Code splitting for improved initial load time
   - Optimized rendering for large lists
   - Caching strategies for frequently accessed data

2. **Additional features**:
   - Advanced transcript processing options
   - Batch processing of multiple videos
   - Enhanced audio generation options
   - User authentication and profiles

3. **Enhanced UI/UX**:
   - Dark mode support
   - Additional themes
   - Keyboard shortcuts
   - Drag-and-drop functionality

## Active Considerations

### Migration Approach

- **Focus on like-for-like migration**: Maintain the same functionality while improving the structure
- **Prioritize working software**: Ensure each migrated feature works before moving to the next
- **Reuse existing logic**: Adapt the current business logic to the new structure without rewriting it
- **Leverage shadcn/ui**: Replace custom UI components with shadcn/ui equivalents where possible

### Key Decisions

1. **Feature Identification**:
   - Identified three main features: Transcript Processing, Configuration, and Downloads
   - Each feature has its own directory with components and hooks

2. **Data Access Strategy**:
   - All data access is centralized in shared data hooks
   - Each entity type has its own hook (useTranscriptData, usePromptData, etc.)
   - Form state persistence is implemented using React Query's caching capabilities

3. **UI Component Strategy**:
   - Use shadcn/ui components as the foundation
   - Create feature-specific components that compose shadcn/ui components
   - Move components to shared only when used by multiple features
   - Ensure consistent UI design across all features

4. **Tooling Decisions**:
   - Using React 18 for improved performance and features
   - Using Tailwind CSS v3 for styling
   - Using shadcn/ui for UI components
   - Created a reusable scaffolding script for future projects

5. **Notification Standard**:
   - Always use toast from components/ui/sonner for all notifications
   - Consistent notification pattern for success and error messages
   - Centralized error handling in API requests
