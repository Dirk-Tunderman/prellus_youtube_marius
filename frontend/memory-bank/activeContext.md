# Active Context: Transcript Automation System Frontend

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus is migrating the Transcript Automation System frontend from its current implementation to a modern architecture using Vite and shadcn/ui. We have successfully completed the initial scaffolding and are now ready to begin migrating the actual functionality. This involves:

1. **Completed: Setting up a new Vite project** with React 18 in the temp_vite_v3 directory
2. **Completed: Implementing the new directory structure** according to the feature-based architecture
3. **Completed: Integrating shadcn/ui** with Tailwind CSS v3 for consistent UI components
4. **Next: Migrating components** from the current implementation to the new structure

## Recent Changes

1. **Project initialization**:
   - Created a memory bank to document the project
   - Analyzed the current codebase to understand its structure and functionality
   - Identified key features and components to migrate

2. **Architecture decisions**:
   - Decided to use Vite for improved development experience
   - Selected shadcn/ui as the component library
   - Defined a feature-based architecture for better organization

3. **Migration planning**:
   - Decided to keep the current codebase in src_old while building the new implementation
   - Planned a phased approach to migrate features one by one
   - Identified core services and utilities to migrate first

4. **Scaffolding implementation**:
   - Created a new Vite project with React 18 in temp_vite_v3
   - Set up Tailwind CSS v3 and configured it properly
   - Installed and configured shadcn/ui with all components
   - Created the feature-based directory structure
   - Set up path aliases for cleaner imports
   - Created a sample App component to verify the setup

5. **Scaffolding script creation**:
   - Developed a reusable `create-feature-app.sh` script for future projects
   - Documented the script usage in a README.md file
   - Made the script executable for easy use

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. **Migrate core services**:
   - Move API service to core/services
   - Refactor service modules to follow the new pattern

2. **Implement shared data hooks**:
   - Create useTranscriptData, usePromptData, useProjectData, and useConfigData hooks
   - Ensure they follow the standardized pattern

3. **Migrate features**:
   - Transcript Processing
   - Configuration management
   - Downloads and project management
   - Prompt management

4. **Set up routing**:
   - Implement core/router.js
   - Define routes for all features

## Active Considerations

### Migration Approach

- **Focus on like-for-like migration**: Maintain the same functionality while improving the structure
- **Prioritize working software**: Ensure each migrated feature works before moving to the next
- **Reuse existing logic**: Adapt the current business logic to the new structure without rewriting it
- **Leverage shadcn/ui**: Replace custom UI components with shadcn/ui equivalents where possible

### Key Decisions

1. **Feature Identification**:
   - Identified three main features: Transcript Processing, Configuration, and Downloads
   - Each feature will have its own directory with components and hooks

2. **Data Access Strategy**:
   - All data access will be centralized in shared data hooks
   - Each entity type will have its own hook (useTranscriptData, usePromptData, etc.)

3. **UI Component Strategy**:
   - Use shadcn/ui components as the foundation
   - Create feature-specific components that compose shadcn/ui components
   - Move components to shared only when used by multiple features

4. **Tooling Decisions**:
   - Using React 18 for improved performance and features
   - Using Tailwind CSS v3 for styling
   - Using shadcn/ui for UI components
   - Created a reusable scaffolding script for future projects
