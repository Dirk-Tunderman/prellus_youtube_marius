# Progress: Transcript Automation System Frontend

## Current Status

The project has progressed from the **management hooks implementation phase** to **completion of all planned feature components and bug fixes**. We have successfully implemented all feature components using shadcn/ui, following the component composition pattern defined in systemPatterns.md. We've also implemented the Context Provider Pattern to resolve state synchronization issues and fixed the delete confirmation dialog bug. All planned components have been implemented, and the project is now waiting for new input/requirements.

5. **Routing**
   - React Router v6 integration
   - Centralized router configuration in core/router.jsx
   - Layout component with navigation
   - NotFound component for 404 error handling

6. **Management Hooks**
   - Feature-specific management hooks for each domain
   - Business logic for transcript processing, configuration, and project management
   - Integration with shared data hooks
   - Proper exports through barrel files

7. **Feature Components**
   - Transcript processing components with shadcn/ui
   - Configuration management UI for API keys and model selection
   - Downloads and project management interface
   - Prompt management components for saving and loading templates
   - Form state persistence between route navigations
   - Responsive design for different screen sizes

## What's Left to Build

All planned components have been implemented, and the project is now waiting for new input/requirements.

| Configuration | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | Complete |
| Downloads | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | Complete |

## Known Issues

No known issues at this time. All previously identified challenges have been addressed:

1. **State Synchronization in Downloads Feature**
   - ✅ RESOLVED: Fixed issue with delete confirmation dialog not appearing
   - Root cause: State updates in one component weren't reflected in others
   - Solution: Implemented Context Provider Pattern to share state across components
   - Benefit: Created a reusable pattern for other features that need shared state

2. **Maintaining API Compatibility**
   - Successfully ensured the new frontend works with the existing backend API
   - Handled differences in data structures appropriately

3. **Component Equivalence**
   - Found appropriate shadcn/ui components for all current UI elements
   - Maintained the same user experience with the new components

4. **Feature Parity**
   - Ensured all current functionality is preserved in the migration
   - Validated that the migrated features work as expected

## Next Milestone

**Awaiting New Requirements**

All planned components have been implemented, and the project is now waiting for new input/requirements. Potential future enhancements could include:

1. **Performance optimization**
2. **Additional features**
3. **Enhanced UI/UX**

Target completion: To be determined based on new requirements
