# Progress: Transcript Automation System Frontend

## Current Status

The project has progressed from the **initial migration planning phase** to the **scaffolding implementation phase**. We have successfully set up the new project structure with Vite, React 18, Tailwind CSS v3, and shadcn/ui components. We are now ready to begin migrating the actual functionality from the existing codebase.

### Project Setup Status

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Memory bank creation | ✅ Complete | Initial documentation created |
| Current codebase analysis | ✅ Complete | Understood existing features and structure |
| New project structure planning | ✅ Complete | Defined in systemPatterns.md |
| Vite project setup | ✅ Complete | Created in temp_vite_v3 with React 18 |
| shadcn/ui integration | ✅ Complete | All components added and configured |
| Scaffolding script creation | ✅ Complete | Reusable script for future projects |

## What Works

### Current Application (src)

The current application (to be preserved in src_old) has the following working features:

#### Core Features

1. **YouTube Transcript Processing**
   - Input YouTube URL and custom prompts
   - Process transcripts with AI
   - Save and load prompt templates

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Configure API keys for various AI providers
   - Select default AI model
   - View available models based on configured API keys

3. **Content Management**
   - View processed transcripts
   - Download transcripts and audio files
   - Delete projects

#### Technical Components

1. **API Integration**
   - Communication with backend services
   - Error handling and response processing

2. **Routing**
   - Navigation between main pages
   - URL-based routing

3. **UI Components**
   - Forms for data input
   - Lists for displaying processed content
   - Modals for confirmations and additional inputs

### New Scaffolding (temp_vite_v3)

The new scaffolding in temp_vite_v3 has the following working components:

1. **Project Structure**
   - Feature-based directory organization
   - Proper separation of concerns
   - Barrel files for clean exports

2. **UI Foundation**
   - All shadcn/ui components installed and configured
   - Tailwind CSS v3 set up and working
   - Sample App component demonstrating the UI

3. **Development Environment**
   - Vite development server with hot module replacement
   - Path aliases configured for cleaner imports
   - JSConfig for better editor support

## What's Left to Build

The functionality from the current application needs to be migrated to the new architecture. This includes:

### Feature Migration

1. **Core Services**
   - API service
   - Authentication (if applicable)
   - Error handling

2. **Data Hooks**
   - Transcript data
   - Project data
   - Configuration data
   - Prompt data

3. **Feature Components**
   - Transcript processing
   - Configuration management
   - Downloads and project management

4. **Routing**
   - Router configuration
   - Route definitions

## Migration Progress

| Feature | Components Migrated | Hooks Migrated | UI Updated | Testing | Status |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|------------|---------|--------|
| Project Setup | 100% | 100% | 100% | 0% | Complete |
| Core Services | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | Not Started |
| Transcript Processing | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | Not Started |
| Configuration | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | Not Started |
| Downloads | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | Not Started |

## Known Issues

Potential challenges for the migration include:

1. **Maintaining API Compatibility**
   - Ensuring the new frontend works with the existing backend API
   - Handling any differences in data structures

2. **Component Equivalence**
   - Finding appropriate shadcn/ui components for all current UI elements
   - Maintaining the same user experience with the new components

3. **Feature Parity**
   - Ensuring all current functionality is preserved in the migration
   - Validating that the migrated features work as expected

## Next Milestone

**Core Services Migration**
- Move API service to core/services
- Implement shared data hooks
- Begin migrating feature components

Target completion: After core services migration
