# Transcript Automation System

## Project Overview
This project aims to automate the processing of client discussion transcripts, enabling efficient extraction of key information, requirements, and action items. By analyzing meeting transcripts systematically, we ensure accurate capture of client needs and can track project progress effectively.

## Based on Client Requirements
This automation system was developed based on detailed discussions with the client, captured in meeting transcripts. The system addresses the following key requirements:
- Automated extraction of transcript content from various sources
- Processing and structuring of transcript data
- Identification of key information, requirements, and action items
- Documentation generation and maintenance
- Progress tracking and reporting
